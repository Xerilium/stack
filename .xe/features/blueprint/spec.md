# Feature: Stack Product Blueprint

## Problem

Stack needs a comprehensive, phased product roadmap that breaks down the complete product vision into discrete, implementable features with clear dependencies and priorities to enable systematic development from POC to enterprise scale.

## Goals

- Document all features required for complete CLI feature parity with PowerShell prototype in Phase 1 (POC)
- Establish clear feature dependencies forming an acyclic dependency graph for parallel execution
- Define Phase 2-5 features at high level for future detailed planning
- Align feature phases with Product Strategy priorities (POC → Mainstream → Innovation → Platform → Enterprise → Scale)
- Enable systematic feature implementation via `/catalyst:rollout {feature-id}` workflow

Explicit non-goals:

- Implementing features during blueprint creation (implementation happens after blueprint PR is merged)
- Detailing Phase 2+ features completely (will be detailed when prior phase completes)
- Changing core PowerShell prototype behavior (preserve existing functionality)

## Scenario

- As a product manager, I need a complete feature roadmap so that I can plan releases and communicate progress to stakeholders.
  - Outcome: Blueprint spec serves as single source of truth for all planned features across all phases
- As an architect, I need feature dependencies clearly mapped so that I can ensure features are built in the correct order without blocking work.
  - Outcome: Dependency graph with system components enables parallel feature development where dependencies allow
- As an engineer, I need clear feature scope boundaries so that I can implement features without scope creep or ambiguity.
  - Outcome: Each feature has 1-2 sentence scope description defining clear boundaries
- As a team, we need Phase 1 features to match PowerShell prototype capabilities so that we achieve complete CLI feature parity.
  - Outcome: All commands, summaries, and workflows from PowerShell prototype are represented as discrete features

## Success Criteria

- All Phase 1 (POC) features documented with clear scope boundaries (1-2 sentences each)
- Feature dependency graph is acyclic and organized by system components
- Features aligned with Product Strategy from `.xe/product.md`
- Each feature includes: ID (kebab-case), phase, dependencies, scope, complexity
- Complexity estimates are realistic (Small: 1-2 days, Medium: 3-5 days, Large: 1-2 weeks)
- Phase 2-4 features outlined at high level
- Blueprint captures all PowerShell prototype capabilities from `../todo/.xe/specs`

## Design principles

- **Complete feature parity first**
  > Phase 1 must implement ALL capabilities from the PowerShell prototype. No features can be deferred to later phases if they exist in the prototype. This ensures the Node.js CLI can fully replace the PowerShell version.

- **Granular feature decomposition**
  > Break features into small, independently testable units following Single Responsibility Principle. Each feature should do one thing well and be independently implementable via `/catalyst:rollout`.

- **Dependency-driven organization**
  > Organize features by system components (CLI, Commands, Summaries, Domain Logic, Data Layer, Automation) rather than implementation order. This enables maximum parallelization while respecting technical constraints.
