# Development Process for Stack

## Living Specification Principle

**Critical**: All specifications (spec.md, plan.md, tasks.md) must represent the final desired state, not a chronological log of changes.

- **spec.md and plan.md** contain only timeless requirements applicable to any future implementation
- **tasks.md** describes implementation steps as if building from scratch
- Exclude one-time setup/migration steps from permanent specs
- When requirements change, update specs to reflect the new desired state (not a diff)

**Example**: If one change adds a button and another later changes it to a link, tasks.md should have one task for "Add link component" with no mention of a button.

## Development Workflow

Use the following development process when assigned to a task or asked to generate code. Each step within each phase should be committed to the branch. **NEVER** commit directly to the `main` branch.

### Phase 0. Setup

- Determine a short, kebab-cased rollout ID
  - Use the feature ID when implementing a single, new feature
  - Use a logical short description when enhancing a feature or fixing a bug
- Create a branch for the rollout
  - **Format**: `{username}/{rollout-id}` for manual work and `xe/{rollout-id}` for Catalyst-executed work (e.g., `flanakin/expand-score-display`)
    - `{username}` should be the GitHub account that owns the feature
    - `{rollout-id}` is a short kebab-cased identifier for the change being implemented
- Create placeholder `.xe/rollouts/rollout-{rollout-id}.md` as the central, async orchestrator for this change and add an entry to `.xe/rollouts/README.md` index for discovery

**Note**: Rollout plans can cover multiple features or a subset of a single feature depending on the scope of change.

### Phase 1. Analysis

1. **Product & Architecture Context**
   - Determine if change affects new or existing features
   - Review `.xe/product.md` and `.xe/architecture.md` for system understanding
   - Review existing features in `.xe/features/` folder
   - Create `.xe/features/{feature-id}/research.md` documenting key findings with date

2. **Market Research** (if new feature or major enhancement)
   - Review `.xe/competitive-analysis.md` (if exists and <3 months old)
     - Update competitive analysis if never documented, >3 months old, or major product pivot
   - Update `research.md` with market insights

3. **Feature Requirements & Source Code**
   - Review related source code per `.xe/architecture.md` structure
   - **For bugs**: Identify faulty component, map to feature, review spec.md/plan.md for intended behavior
   - **For existing feature changes**:
     - Review spec.md (requirements) and plan.md (implementation)
     - Identify refactoring opportunities and technical debt
     - Assess cleanup scope, risk vs benefit, and rollout timing
   - **For multi-feature changes**:
     - Identify primary feature and create dependency tree
     - Process primary feature first, then dependencies
   - Update `research.md` with:
     - Code paths and component ownership
     - Related specs, plans, tasks
     - Dependencies and integrations
     - Migration and technical debt implications

### Phase 2. Specification

- Define WHAT and WHY (user value, business needs), not HOW (implementation)
  - **New features**: Create `.xe/features/{feature-id}/spec.md` from template
  - **Enhancements**: Update existing spec.md; consider extracting to separate feature if compartmentalized
  - **Bugs**: Update spec.md only if requirements were unclear
- Focus on user value and business needs
- Write for non-technical stakeholders and AI code generation
- Define platform/integration requirements, not technology constraints
- Ensure requirements are testable and unambiguous
- Ensure success criteria are measurable
- Document all dependencies and assumptions

### Phase 3. Planning

**Purpose**: Create implementation plan that serves as design approval checkpoint before code generation.

**CRITICAL**: All planning documents (plan.md, tasks.md) describe implementation from scratch, as if no code exists. Use "Create", "Implement", "Build" - NOT "Modify", "Add to", "Update".

- Step 0: Research & Design Decisions
  - _Prerequisites: spec.md complete_
  - Think deeply about how to best implement this feature within the technical constraints defined by `.xe/architecture.md`:
    - What specific problem does this feature solve? (reference spec.md scenarios)
    - What are the edge cases and failure modes?
    - What existing patterns/features can be reused?
  - Consider design alternatives:
    - What alternative approaches were considered?
    - Why was this approach chosen? (tradeoffs, constraints, alignment with architecture)
    - What research was needed?
  - Document pivotal technical decisions in `research.md`:
    - Decision: [what was chosen]
    - Rationale: [why chosen]
    - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]
    - Data flow: [inputs, transformations, outputs]
  - Validate architecture fit:
    - How does this align with `.xe/architecture.md` patterns?
    - What new patterns does this introduce?
    - How does this feature compose with existing features?

- Step 1: Data Model
  - _Prerequisites: research.md complete_
  - Define data entities this feature introduces or modifies
  - **ALWAYS document entities inline in `plan.md` `## Data Model` section**
  - Only create separate `data-model.md` if entities are complex (3+ entities with state machines/complex validation)
  - For each entity, document:
    - Entity name, purpose, fields with types
    - Key relationships to other entities
    - Validation rules from functional requirements
    - State transitions if applicable
  - Split entities into:
    - Entities owned by this feature
    - Entities from other features (consumed)

- Step 2: Contracts
  - _Prerequisites: Data model complete_
  - **ALWAYS document contracts inline in `plan.md` `## Contracts` section**
  - **For function/library features:**
    - Define function signatures with comprehensive help/documentation
    - Document parameter types, validation, return values
    - Include 1-2 usage examples per function
  - **For REST/GraphQL API features:**
    - Generate API contracts from functional requirements
    - For each user action → endpoint
    - Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns
    - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `.xe/features/{feature-id}/contracts/api.yaml`
    - Reference schema in plan.md, summarize key endpoints
  - **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
    - One test file per endpoint/function
    - Assert request/response schemas or function signatures
    - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)
  - **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
    - Each story → integration test scenario
    - Quickstart test = story validation steps

- Step 3: Implementation Approach
  - _Prerequisites: Contracts complete_
  - Create `plan.md` based on `node_modules/@xerilium/catalyst/templates/specs/plan.md` template
  - Document HOW the feature will be built from scratch (not as enhancement)
  - Structure using H3 subsections (for 3-8 concerns):
    1. Data Structures (input/output formats, entity schemas)
    2. Core Algorithms (step-by-step logic with numbered lists)
    3. Integration Points (dependencies and consumers)
    4. Error Handling (graceful degradation, edge cases)
    5. Performance Considerations (optimization strategies, profiling)
    6. Testing Strategy (unit/integration/performance approaches, >90% coverage)
  - For complex features with distinct phases: Consider breaking into multiple H2 sections
  - Include code examples (pseudocode or actual syntax) for complex logic
  - Reference `research.md` for design rationale (don't duplicate)
  - Follow specification writing standards (see below)

- Step 4: Usage Examples
  - _Prerequisites: Implementation Approach complete_
  - Document how future developers will consume this feature after it's built
  - Create `plan.md ## Usage Examples` section with 2-3 practical examples:
    1. Basic usage (minimal parameters)
    2. Advanced usage (with optional parameters)
    3. Common integration pattern (if applicable)
  - Show what "working" looks like (validates design makes sense)
  - AI uses these for generating integration code and tests

- Step 5: Task Breakdown
  - _Prerequisites: plan.md complete_
  - Generate `tasks.md` based on the `node_modules/@xerilium/catalyst/templates/specs/tasks.md` template with implementation task breakdown:
    - Contains ONLY repeatable implementation steps (code, tests, docs)
    - Never includes one-time migration/setup actions
    - Describes final state, not incremental changes
    - Written as if building from scratch (use "Create", "Implement", not "Modify", "Add to")
    - Can be processed by AI agents, automation, or humans
  - Generate tasks from design docs (contracts, data model, test scenarios):
    - Each contract → contract test task
    - Each entity → model creation task
    - Each user story → integration test scenario task
    - Implementation tasks to make tests pass
    - Polish tasks (edge cases, documentation, code review)

- Step 6: Rollout Orchestration
  - _Prerequisites: tasks.md complete_
  - Update `.xe/rollouts/rollout-{rollout-id}.md` with full details based on `node_modules/@xerilium/catalyst/templates/specs/rollout.md` template
  - Add feature references to rollout frontmatter: `features: [list]` (can span multiple features)
  - Rollout orchestrates: pre-implementation → tasks.md → post-implementation → cleanup
  - Simple changes may have empty pre/post sections
  - One-time migration/setup actions go in rollout, NOT in tasks.md
  - Follow template instructions for complete structure

- Step 7: Approval Checkpoint
  - Review and approve `plan.md` before implementation (design approval checkpoint):
    - **Data Model**: Are entities/schemas correct?
    - **Contracts**: Are function signatures/APIs correct?
    - **Implementation Approach**: Is algorithm logic sound?
    - **Usage Examples**: Does the design make sense to consume?
  - Review and approve `tasks.md` (implementation checklist complete?)
  - Review and approve rollout plan (orchestration defined?)
  - **DO NOT proceed to implementation without explicit approval**

### Phase 4. Implementation

**Entry point:**

- Follow rollout plan as the orchestrator for the entire workflow

**Rollout orchestrated workflow:**

1. Execute pre-implementation actions (if any)
2. Execute `.xe/features/{feature-id}/tasks.md` implementation checklist:
   - Extract reusable code from existing code first
   - Create new reusable code next (with unit tests and high coverage)
   - AI-assisted code generation following approved `spec.md` and plan.md
   - Focus only on code required for this task (YAGNI)
   - Keep changes small and scoped to single responsibility
   - Generate or update tests in expected location per architecture spec
   - Validate behavior, not internal implementation details
3. Execute post-implementation actions (if any)
4. Complete immediate cleanup actions
5. Delete rollout plan file when complete
6. Remove entry from `.xe/rollouts/README.md`

### Phase 5. Validation

All validation steps below must pass before proceeding to Phase 6.

- `npm run format` - Format all markdown and code files
- `npm run lint` - Run linting checks (zero critical issues required)
- `npm run test` - Execute all unit and integration tests (no failures or warnings)
- Verify code coverage meets target per `.xe/engineering.md`
- Ensure all standards in `.xe/standards/` are applied
- Code quality review (readability, maintainability, patterns)
- Security review (input validation, sanitization, vulnerabilities)
- Performance review (efficiency, resource usage, bottlenecks)
- Documentation completeness (`spec.md`, `plan.md`, code comments)

### Phase 6. Review

- Create a new pull request into the default branch
  - Set the title to `[Catalyst][{type}] {feature-name}`, where `{type}` is "Feature" or "Bug" and `{feature-name}` is a friendly display name
  - Summarize the feature or bug fixed in the body description
  - If the change is related to an issue, include `Fixes #{id}`, if the issue is fully resolved, or `Related to #{id}`, if not
- If the project uses GitHub Copilot as a reviewer on PRs, assign `copilot-swe-agent` as a reviewer

## Feature Documentation Structure

Each feature in `.xe/features/{feature-id}/` contains:

- **`spec.md`** - WHAT: Business requirements, acceptance criteria, success metrics
- **`plan.md`** - HOW: Technical design, architectural decisions, integration patterns
- **`tasks.md`** - TODO: Implementation task breakdown (describes final state)

Templates for each file are located in `node_modules/@xerilium/catalyst/templates/specs/`.

## Rollout Plan Structure

Every feature requires a rollout plan as the orchestrator. See [`node_modules/@xerilium/catalyst/templates/specs/rollout.md`](../templates/specs/rollout.md) for the complete template.

**Directory structure:**

```text
.xe/rollouts/
├── README.md                      # Active rollouts index for AI discovery
└── rollout-{rollout-id}.md        # Individual rollout plans
```

**Key concepts:**

- **Template**: Use [`node_modules/@xerilium/catalyst/templates/specs/rollout.md`](node_modules/@xerilium/catalyst/templates/specs/rollout.md) as starting point
- **Lifecycle**: Placeholder created during specification → completed during planning → deleted after implementation
- **Orchestration**: Coordinates pre-implementation → tasks.md → post-implementation → cleanup
- **Scope**: Can cover multiple features, single feature, or subset of a feature
- **Flexibility**: Simple changes may have empty pre/post/cleanup sections
- **Tracking**: Markdown checkbox lists with status updates in frontmatter

**Discovery index: `.xe/rollouts/README.md`**

- Lists active rollouts with one-line descriptions
- AI scans this to find relevant rollout for current work
- Updated when rollouts are created or deleted
- Example:

  ```markdown
  # Active Rollouts

  - [rollout-update-metadata.md](./rollout-update-metadata.md) - Create update-metadata orchestrator
  - [rollout-migrate-specs.md](./rollout-migrate-specs.md) - Migrate feature.md → spec.md
  ```

## Specification Writing Standards

### Requirements Specifications (spec.md)

- **Purpose**: Define WHAT the feature does - business requirements, acceptance criteria, success metrics
- **Focus**: User-facing behavior, functional requirements, validation criteria
- **Avoid**: Implementation details, code examples, hardcoded configuration values
- **Living Specification Principle**: Include only requirements applicable to any future implementation; exclude one-time setup/migration steps

### Implementation Plans (plan.md)

- **Purpose**: Define HOW the feature integrates - technical design, component interactions, engineering decisions
- **Focus**: Architectural decisions, data flow, integration points, processing logic
- **Avoid**:
  - Duplicating requirements from `spec.md` (reference instead)
  - Pseudo-code that will drift from implementation (describe flow, don't write code)
  - Hardcoded configuration values (reference config files instead)
- **Best Practices**:
  - Use decision tables and flow diagrams instead of code samples
  - Reference actual implementation files as source of truth
  - Focus on architectural decisions, not implementation details
